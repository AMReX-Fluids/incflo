Welcome to incflo's documentation!
====================================

incflo is an AMReX-based simulation code for modeling
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence
of complex geometries.  It includes adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) 
but without subcycling in time.

For an AMReX-based incompressible flow code with subcycling in time, please go to 

https://amrex-codes.github.io/IAMR/

Active development in incflo is ongoing in the development branch. 
Changes are merged into the master branch at the beginning of each month.
