Welcome to incflo's documentation!
====================================

incflo is an AMReX-based simulation code for modeling
the variable density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence
of complex geometries.  It includes adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
but without subcycling in time.

For an AMReX-based incompressible flow code with subcycling in time, please see `IAMR <https://amrex-fluids.github.io/IAMR/>`_

Active development in incflo is ongoing in the development branch.
